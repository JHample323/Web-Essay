								<h2>Antikythera Mechanism</h2>
								<p>Antikythera mechanism is an ancient greek analogue computer</p>
							</header>
						</div>
						<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
							<p>The antikythera was the very first "computer", it was used in predicting astronomical positions. Being able to predict astronomical positions helped the Greeks when making calendars. The computer even had a four year cycle used for athletic games
								(Olympics). Without this device, the computer as we know it today could ultimately not exist. Now while this isn't a "digital" computer, it is considered an analog computer.</p>

					we can also do projects much easier.</p>
